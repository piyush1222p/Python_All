#Class and Objects:
#A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the properties and behavior of an object.
#An object is an instance of a class and has its own set of attributes (data) and
#methods (functions) that can be used to manipulate the object.

#Class Varirables:
#Class variables are variables that are shared by all instances of a class.
#Instance Variable are those on which class attributes are assigned.

#Inheritance in  Class:
#There can be two type of classes one is Parent and other is Child class
#Child class will inherit all the properties aka attributes and methods of parent class.
#Inheritance is used to create a new class from an existing class.

#Multi-level Inheritance in Class:
#In multi-level inheritance, a child class inherits the properties and methods of a parent class and the
#parent class also inherits the properties and methods of another parent class.
