#Zip Function:
    #The zip() function takes iterables, aggregates(combine form) them in a tuple, and returns it.
    #The zip() function stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted.
    #The zip() function is used to merge two or more lists or other iterables into a list
    # of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequence or iterables.
